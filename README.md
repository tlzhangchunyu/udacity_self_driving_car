# Udacity_self_driving_car

This repository contains the notes and project file about Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program, which I started on 10 July, 2019. This is a online course for learning the technology and programing of autonomouse driving system. 
The program is developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA,etc.

# Program Outline:

Term 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

1. Computer Vision
computer-vision-notes-and-labs: Notes on Computer Vision
Project 1: Finding Lane Lines (Intro to Computer Vision)
Project 4: Advanced Lane Lines
Project 5: Vehicle Detection

2. Deep Learning
deep-learning-notes-and-labs: Notes on Deep Learning, Tensorflow and Keras
Project 2: Traffic Sign Classifier
Project 3: Behavioural Cloning
Train a car to drive in a 3D simulator using a deep neural network.
Input data comprises steering angles and camera images captured by driving with a keyboard / mouse / joystick in the simulator.

3. Sensor Fusion
Combining lidar and radar data to track objects in the environment using Kalman filters.
Project 1: Extended Kalman Filters
Project 2: Unscented Kalman Filters


Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

1. Localisation
Locate a car relative to the world (Align a car and sensors to the map).
Use particle filters to localise the vehicle.
Project 3: Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filters)

3. Control
Fundamental concepts of robotic control.
Build algorithms to steer car and wheels so as to meet an objective.
Project 4: PID Controller
Project 5: Model Predictive Control

Term 3: Path Planning, Controlling a Self-Driving Car
1. Path Planning
Finding a sequence of steps in a maze (navigating cities, parking lots)
Project 1: Path Planning (Driving a car down a highway with other cars in a simulator)
2. Advanced Deep Learning: Semantic Segmentation
Fully Convolutional Networks
Inference Performance (Optimising NNs in TensorFlow for Inference Speed)
Project 2: Semantic Segmentation (Identifying free space on the road in a video clip)
3. Functional Safety
4. System Integration
Put your code in a self-driving car
