# Udacity_self_driving_car

This repository contains the notes and project file about Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program, which I started on 10 July, 2019. This is a online course for learning the technology and programing of autonomouse driving system. The program is developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA,etc.

# Program Outline:

## Term 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

#### Project 1: Finding Lane Lines(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect the lane of highway from a video. Used OpencV image techniques suck as Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection etc.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding(Computer Vision) 
   
**Summary**: Detect the lane of highway from a video with camera calibration, color spaces, and sliding window etc.
   
**Solution**: Python

### Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier(Deep Learning)
   
**Summary**: Build a CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) to determine the traffic sign from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.
   
**Solution**: Python, TensorFlow

### Project 4: Behavioural Cloning(Deep Learning)

**Summary**: Build and train a CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) with the library of Keras to control the car can run around the track.
   
**Solution**: Python, Keras

### Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters(Sensor Fusion)
**Summary**: Build and train a CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) with the library of Keras to control the car can run around the track.
   
**Solution**: Python, Keras

Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

1. Localisation

   Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filters)

2. Path Planning

   Project 7: Highway Driving

3. Control

   Project 8: PID Controller

4. Road Segmentation
