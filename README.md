# Udacity_self_driving_car

This repository contains the notes and project file about Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree program, which I started on 10 July, 2019. This is a online course for learning the technology and programing of autonomouse driving system. The program is developed by Udacity in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, NVIDIA,etc.

# Program Outline:

Term 1: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Sensor Fusion

1. Computer Vision

   Project 1: Finding Lane Lines 
   
   ・Summary: Detect the lane of highway from a video. Used OpencV image techniques suck as Hough Transforms and 
                                            Canny edge detection etc.
               
   ・Solution: Python

   Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding

2. Deep Learning

   Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier

   Project 4: Behavioural Cloning

3. Sensor Fusion

   Project 5: Extended Kalman Filters

Term 2: Localization, Path Planning, Control, and System Integration

1. Localisation

   Project 6: Kidnapped Vehicle (Particle Filters)

2. Path Planning

   Project 7: Highway Driving

3. Control

   Project 8: PID Controller

4. Road Segmentation

   Put your code in a self-driving car
