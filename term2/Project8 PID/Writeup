[Intuition of the video]
1.without control
	The steer doesn't work, the went to the right 
    
2.with only P_control(proportional)
	It had effect on the car'movement. If the car the right it turns hard to the left, if it's slightly to the left it turn slightly to the right.
    But angle of steer was getting biggerï¼Œit didn't be convergence.
    
3.with only I_control(integral)
	It doesn't work at all. In the lesson it only worked for offset.
    
4.with only D_control(differential)
	It had worked for controlling the steer of the car, but it was very late. On the curve it cannot let the car turn back quickly.
   
5.with PID_control
	As the video had shown it works well. The can can run around the track without leaving the road.
    
    
[Discuss the final hyperparameters ]
To determine the hyperparameters of the PID that the car can drive safely around the track, I used manual tuning and the twiddle algorithm.
1. I set the hyperparameters of the PID (P=0.2, I=0.004, D=3.0) as the same as the introduction on lesson
2. When the angle of the steer was getting bigger, I setted the P lower.
3. I used twiddle to optimize, the need to pay attention to the optimization is that the faster the target speed,  value of D should be smaller.
