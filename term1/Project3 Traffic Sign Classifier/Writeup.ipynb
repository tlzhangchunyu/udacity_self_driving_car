Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "For the optimizer: I set a learning rate of 0.001. After several trial, Adam Optimizer works better than gradient descent optimizer since it adapts the learning rate better according to the losses.\n",

Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "I used the  basic data of validation images data.But, as the training images data have 34799 the validation image data have only 4410.It is only 12.6% as the training data.So I change the scale of training data and validation data to 20%. The result has changed from 0.91 to 0.988.\n",
